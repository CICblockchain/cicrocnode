## Requirements: 
Docker and Docker Compose
Ubuntu / Ubuntu-like server

git clone https://github.com/cicblockchain/rpcnode.git
cd rpcnode

You may need to give permissions to sh files. To do so, run: 
chmod +x *.sh

Depending on your Ubuntu version, run: 
./pre-setup2004.sh 
Or:
./pre-setup2204.sh

Then run: 
./run.sh
 
# docker-compose.yml file includes all the needed information. 
You can adjust some variables if you are familiar with that.

## Additional commands:
./stop.sh: stops the node keeping its data.
./resume.sh: resumes the node, it runs after stop.sh
./restart.sh: restarts the node container
./remove.sh: removes the node data completely
./qlogs.sh: displays the node container logs
./johnwickdocker.sh: destroys all docker related resources, starts clean

To test if the node is working:
1. Paste your server's IP with port 22000 in a web browser: 192.168.25.24:22000 
   If a blank white page is displayed, your node is working fine. Else, you'll get an error. 
2. In MetaMask network settings, place the address: http://your-ip:22000 for the RPC URL. 
   If you connect to the network, it means you are set. But you may need to wait for synchronization to complete. 
   During synchronization (first hour or so) your wallet balance will not reflect the correct value.
