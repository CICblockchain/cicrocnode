Developer guide to Crazy Internet Coin blockchain.

## CIC Chain Intro
CIC chain is a permissioned public blockchain. 
It is a high-performance, scalable, customizable, and secure EVM smart-contract platform, that combines permissions with decentralisation and efficiency. This combination puts an end to the inefficiency problem the has always accompanied blockchains.
 
## The Challenge
For a blockchain to gain community trust as a public ledger, this blockchain must be decentralized. In other words, it is public and open to anyone that wants to participate in any manner, from reading the ledger transactions to deploying smart contracts and setting up blockchain nodes. 

That was the theory. but in reality bad actors are still able to practice scams using these public blockchains. The need for a powerful authority cannot be denied. Traditional methods were the only choice to limit scam incidents, which meant we were back to square one. The square where all leads are controlled centralizely. 

Accordingly, lack of command imposed by an authority leads to misbehaviour and results in harm. The solution is a decentralized public blockchain with decentralized law enforcement method. Here where CIC kicks in.

## Community DAO
By utising the power of on-chain permissioned EVM with the flexibility of smart contracts, CIC team introduces the first permissioned public blockchain, with power in hands of the community which is allowed to propose votes, and vote to proposals. Examples of proposal may include:

* `Accounts` - like suspending a scammer wallet, halting a smart contract.
* `Development` - such as chain settings, gas price, burning...
* `Events` - like proposals to join or create events in different forms.
* `Ideas` - such as implementing community ideas and visions.
