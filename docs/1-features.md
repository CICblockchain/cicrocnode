Developer guide to Crazy Internet Coin blockchain.

## Hybrid
CIC chain is a permissioned public blockchain. It consists of a native private and permissioned blockchain, and uses smart contracts to decentralise permissions assignment. 
 
## Scam Detterence
Users have a piece of mind in an open, public, low gas cost, secure, reliable blockchain, with no possible way for any central authority to compromise or misuse this open environment. Additionally, a way to corner scammers and thieves and prevent their behaviour. 

## Block Time
Varies between 5 seconds if transactions are present, and a period of up to 1 minute for empty blocks when no transactions are occuring on the blockchain. This approach saves both processing and storage resources significantly.

## Zero Finality
Trusting peer validators lead to immediate finality. since no need to wait for additional confirmations for a signed transaction, partially addressing the known inefficiency attribution for blockchains.

## Permissioning
Flexible user management solutions, allowing deployers and businesses to build multi-level access for their on-chain services.

## Community Control
CIC [DAO](https://dao.cicscan.com) is the first decenralised application (dApp) that hands the management of a private and permissioned chain to the public community.
